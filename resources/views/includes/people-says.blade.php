            <p>&ldquo;It's located in the heart of Zell am See, practically in the pedestrian area. Really everything is just a few minutes of walk. The owner offered a private parking place and generally he was flexible, spoke english well, so administration and communication was perfect..&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;“The location couldn't really get any better - it is right in the main area where all of the shops and restaurants are located, only 10 minutes walk to the train station and 1 minute walk to the lake. The room was super clean and spacious. Staff were excellent and provided local tips and information at check in. There is a very small amount of parking at the hotel but they can also provide a card to park in the underground parking for free which is only 5-10 minutes walk from the accommodation. .&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;This was a wonderful Pension right in the heart of town, close to the ski rental shop and ski lift. The manager was great, he offered us an upgraded room for our first night, it was an awesome room with the most beautiful view of the mountains! A private shower in the room was excellent, and the sink was handy to have in the room. Could not recommend this pension more!h.&rdquo;</p>
